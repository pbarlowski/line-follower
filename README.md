# line-follower

Line Follower was created as part of a project for the Microcontrollers in Automation course during my studies. As the name suggests, it is a mobile robot that follows a line which determine its path. It is one of the categories in numerous robotics competitions, where the constructor of the fastest vehicle wins. Building a robot of this type combines elements of mechanical construction, electronic control system, and control software.

## Used elements
- reflective sensor TCRT5000
- DC L293D bridge H
- Arduino Uno
- few wires
- piece of wood
- small plastic wheel
